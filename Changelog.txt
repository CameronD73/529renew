V 0.1.8   (beta)  - submitted to Chrome store as initial version
changes between v0.1.8 and 1.0.0:
    create DB upon extension installation
    rename some "529 and You" buttons, files, etc to reduce chance of clash.
    round cM values on import from CSV file.
    fix problem where segments might get duplicated after import.
V 1.0.0  submitted to  Chrome store - 2022-10-17
changes between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0
    change when results tab is automatically brought to the front
    Fix logic error causing program to unconditionally reread segments whether or not it had them already.
    Add option to optionally force segment reread if alt-click is used.
    Improve alerts on "expired context" errors.
    Changed text on triangulating button
V 1.1.0  submitted to  Chrome store - 2022-10-22
changes between v1.1.0 and v1.2
    Fixed recording of "lastCSVExport" date - program was ignoring "all chromosome" requests but incorrectly recording when data for a single chromosome was exported.
    Transferred general settings to popup page
    Added debug settings to popup UI. (settings storage object changed from version 0 to 1)
    Removed the "get 23andMe comparison" button from overlapping segments table (results tab) because it never seemed to do anything.
    Implemented the minimum segment overlap operation, to remove segments that only just touch each other.  Improved efficiency of segment match code
    Add user setting for minimum non-overlap saving.  When using shift-click on triangulate, segments between matches that do not overlap are also stored.
	    This setting allows the user to limit this operation to only cases that have at least a certain percentage shared. Also added option
        "Always Save", so that you do not have to remember to use the shift key.
    Added option: closeTabImmediate - if set to true, then the tab will be closed as soon as the triangulation completes.
    Save all percentage shared DNA values listed in the relatives-in-common table. Not used in any way yet, but may have value later.
    
V 1.2.1  submitted to  Chrome store - 2023-01-11
changes between V1.2.1 and 1.2.5
    changed layout of tables with matching segments and overlapping segments. Start and End addresses are displayed in Mbase (to 2 d.p.)
    added date of segment read.
    Segment matches for a single chromosome generate graphical display underneath table.
    Fix code that detected user trying to triangulate before loading relatives in common table
    
V 1.2.5 submitted to Chrome store 2023-01-16
significant changes between 1.2.5 and 1.2.6
    fixed problem with upper/lower case confusion in icon files, for situations where the filesystem is case-sensitive.

V 1.2.6  submitted to Chrome store 2023-04-13

V 1.3.0  submitted to Chrome store mid-September 2023
    23 and Me changed the way ICW matches were displayed, removing the yes/no indicator of overlap.  This release was required to enable 529renew to continue to work.  The "minimum pct shared" parameter became meaningless due to the 23andMe changes, and so was altered slightly to any available ICW matches

V1.9.0  submitted to Chrome store  11-Oct-2023
    major changes, to permit migration of WebSQL database to an sqlite API based on sqlite-WASM.  In the 1.9 series, both database interfaces are included.
    Normal functionality is not available in the V1.9 series, as those most of those routines still use the webSQL api.
    The opportunity was taken to substantially modify the DB schema.

V2.0.0   submission to Chrome store around 7 November 2023.
    Has no webSQL code.
    Sqlite-WASM v 3.44.0
    _Does not work fully_ because 23andMe have disabled segment display.
    Bug in V1.9.x fixed = "finalise" button did not do what was expected, also had applied ICWscanned to too many relatives.
    Most functionality restored, some new features.
    Sqlite DB file can be backed up and restored.
    Some code to manipulate the page appearance depending on DB information.
    Settings/Options changed:
	BaseAddressRounding - has been removed - always zero.
	RelativesPixelPadding - change the padding above and below each person on the relatives list
	NotesLength - display Notes on DNARelatives list page.
    Star means have-triangulated - If you previously use the star to indicate that you had triangulated.
    Action for duplicate imports - whether csv imports update older values or not.

V2.0.1 submitted to store 2024-Jan-01
    _Does not work fully_ because 23andMe have disabled segment display. Added notes to warn about this in the "Whatsnew" page
    Tinkered with the debugging output.
    fixed bug: incorrect warning about failing to import sqlite DB, when it is in fact valid.

V2.1.0 submitted to store 2024-Oct-nn
    A quick hack for people to get as much data as possible in case 23andMe goes down the gurgler.
    Sqlite-WASM v 3.60.0
    PapaParse v 5.4.0

V2.2.0 submitted to Chrome store 2024-Oct-20
