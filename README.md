# 529renew
Chrome extension to allow "23 and me" customers to extract their DNA segment match information
## Background
This is a fork of the *529andYou* Chrome extension, in order to move from manifest V2 to V3. V2 code will cease working for Chrome users past early 2023,
and has been blocked for fresh installations beyond July 2022.

Most of the original source was public domain and we have been unable to contact the original developer.

The repository contains a modified copy of the code from manifest version 2 as well as the development towards a manifest V3 extension.

Most of the details are in [this project's Wiki](https://github.com/CameronD73/529renew/wiki).
## Version 2 installation
The manifest version 2 code is a minimal change from the original 529andYou extension. It includes:
* modifications to the original code that was released in the public domain.
* a copy from 2013 of the 3rd party [FileSaver.js code](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) under an MIT licence.
* new image logos in png format, as the original logos were explicitly excluded from the public domain licence.

This is not for the faint-hearted and something you should only do if you feel confident following [these instructions from the wiki](https://github.com/CameronD73/529renew/wiki/Installing-manifest-V2-code), or if you have no other choice.


## Version 3 installation
This is for testing purposes prior to an extension being placed in the Chrome store.
