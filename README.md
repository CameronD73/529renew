Chrome extension to allow "23 and me" customers to extract their DNA segment match information

This is a fork of the 529andYou Chrome extension, in order to move from manifest V2 to V3. V2 code will cease working for Chrome users past early 2023.
Most of the original source was public domain and we have been unable to contact the original developer.
