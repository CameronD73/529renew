# 529renew
Chrome extension to allow "23 and me" customers to extract their DNA segment match information

This is now available on the Chrome Store.

## Background
This is a fork of the *529andYou* Chrome extension, in order to move from manifest V2 to V3. V2 code will cease working for Chrome users past early 2023,
and has been blocked for fresh installations beyond July 2022.

Most of the original source was public domain and we have been unable to contact the original developer.

The repository contains a modified copy of the code from manifest version 2 as well as the development towards a manifest V3 extension.

Most of the details are in [this project's Wiki](https://github.com/CameronD73/529renew/wiki).

## Installation
The latest released version is available in the Chrome store. For experimental installs, details are in the wiki.
