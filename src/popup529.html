            <p>The number of seconds to delay between each segment request to the <i>23 and me</i> server.
                If we slow it here then it should reduce blocking from them.
            If you see Error 429 more than rarely, then that is the most common indicator that this value needs increasing.</p>

            <p>Number of decimal places to save cM values - any more than 1 is most likely meaningless, 2 is very safe.
                Its only effect is to make displayed values neater and exported csv files smaller.

                <p> This is the number of pixels of blank space used to pad out the top and bottom of each person on the DNA relatives list. 
                    The default used by 23andMe was 16.

            <p>
                If this number is greater than zero then any <i>Notes</i> you have added to the DNA relative will be displayed
                after the name. No more than this number of characters will be displayed in the  relatives list -
                the full number will always  be shown in the original Notes section on the relative's individual profile page.

            </select></h3>
            <p>Number that indicates the minimum required overlap before 529Renew will display two overlapping segments. Units are in Mega-base pair address.
                This <i>applies only to the display in the Browser results page</i> - it does not have any affect on data stored or exported, for example to GDAT.

            <p>If you only applied the yellow star to a relative who had been previously triangulated,
                then set this to yes and 529Renew will change displays accordingly.
                It has no other meaning and is only useful transitioning data from before version 2.

                This parameter sets a lower limit - only matches having at least this <i>percentage</i> in common  will have their matching segments examined.
                Say your profile person <strong>A</strong> is in common with <strong>X</strong>
                and <strong>Y</strong>, then 529renew might store the matching segments
                between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, or
                between <strong>A</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>, or 
                between <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>  - whichever share greater that this limit. 
                Note that the test is applied individually to each pair of matches.

            <p><i>This option is currently inactive</i> (as of Sept 2023).
                Because the code now has to first read the matching segments
                to determine if there is any overlap, it will always save the segment data.

                Say your profile person <strong>A</strong> is in common with <strong>X</strong>
                and <strong>Y</strong> but the matching segments do not overlap.
                Normal recording of "triangulation"  only accepts matches with 3-way overlaps.
                You can also shift-select to save segment details between  <strong>the profile person</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>
                and between <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> when they do not overlap.

            <p>You can adjust this date back if you think something went wrong with an export or GDAT import.
                Each segment match has a date that is either "when read from 23 and me" or "when imported from CSV".
                Segments are normally only exported when their date is equal to or newer than the "Date of last CSV export" on the assumption that GDAT will already have older data.  Dates are also updated if anything in the relatives or the ICW records are changed.

            <h4>Status of ICW chromosome matching</h4>
            <p>The next tables are related to diagnosing issues with overlapping chromosome matches - it is meaningless while the chromosome browser is unavailable.</p>
            <p>This next table should  appear only if the <i>ICWSets2way</i> or <i>ICWSets3way</i> values are more than zero.
                <br/>
                It shows the number of ICW sets on each chromosome.
                The counts <i>exclude segments when the other two matches are close relatives</i> (>500cM to each other);
                Multiple kit profiles are often of close relatives, and will have many ICW overlaps, so the table is divided into two mutually exclusive sets:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>x2p:</i> a count excluding ICW sets where more than one match is a profile person.</li>
                <li><i>i2p:</i> counts only ICW sets where two or more matches include your managed profiles.</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>"No check" is a count of every ICW set that 529Renew has seen but not scanned the other match.</li>
                <li>"3-way false" means that we have confirmed there is not triangulation (this includes two-way overlaps and those with no overlap).</li>
                <li>A 2-way overlap means 529Renew has determined that, while the profile kit overlaps the two ICW DNA relatives on the same chromosome segment,
                the third pair does not overlap in the same place, so there is no (or low) likelihood of triangulation.</li>
