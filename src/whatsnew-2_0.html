    <title>What's new in 529Renew</title>
  </head>
  <body style="font-size: medium;">
    <h2>Changes with version 2 of 529Renew.</h2>
    <h3>This page  appears only when 529renew is upgraded from version 1.x to 2.0 </h3>
    <p>
      This <b>major</b> change was required by 30 October 2023, when Chromium-based browsers removed the <i>WebSQL API</i> that was a core part of 529Renew.
    </p>
    <h4>Version 1.9.x - mid to late October 2023</h4>
    <p>With that version you were able to migrate your existing database, however that pathway is no longer available, as the code to access the
    	old database is no longer present in Chrome.
    </p>
    <h4>Version 2.x - introduced late October 2023</h4>
    <p>
      Starting around the 26th October, all code relating to the old database (WebSQL API) was removed.
      It is likely to be incomplete, and subsequent updates should follow to reach at least the same functionality as V1.3.
    </p>
    <h2>Migration Pathway</h2>
    <p>
      There are three possible scenarios:
    	If you have not already carried out the migration, using V1.9 then you will be starting with an empty database
    </p>
    <p>This process is set out in buttons on the "529Renew Results" tab, as shown in this screenshot.</p>
    <h3>1. prepare a profile table.</h3>
    <p>
      This is <i>an essential first step</i>.
      The profile table will be a tiny CSV file, which you need to create, identifying all the kits that you manage on 23 and Me.
      It might be a good idea to put older generations first (future code might be optimised on this assumption.)
      The format is very simple:
      <ul>
        <li>column 1: the 16-character ID that 23andMe uses to identify the profile, the same as GDAT uses. The allowed characters are digits 0 to 9 and alphabetic a to f.</li>
        <li>column 2: any short name allowing you to recognise the person when using 529Renew.  It does <i>not</i>
        need to be the same as used for the kits in 23andMe</li>
      </ul>
      <p><i>The first line will be ignored</i>, so use it to put in a reminder heading.
      Your file will look like something like this example:</p>
      <pre style="font-size:larger;">
        ID, name     # this file is for initial entry to 529Renew
        1234567890abcdef,Mum     
        abcdef1234567890,My-name  
      </pre>
      Any quotation marks will be removed automatically, but extraneous embedded commas may cause errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the file is ready, click the button labelled <b>Import DNA kit list</b> and select the file you have just created.
    </p>
    <p>
      When loaded, the dropdown "<i>Select profile for import</i>" (see arrow in screenshot) should show the people in the list you have just imported.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Import all CSV export files from 23andMe</h3>
    <p>
      This refers to the CSV files obtained using the "<i>Request DNA Relatives Data Download</i>" button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importing these files is the fastest way to load the background details of the DNA relatives, including data not previously stored by 529.
      Because 23andMe only provide a fixed number of matches, there will always be people dropping from the list as stronger matches are tested.
      By processing <i>all</i> your previously downloaded files, you can retain this information in one place, even though much of it is not used directly by 529 at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This routine allows you to select and process multiple files at once, although they must always be for the one profile person, as that information is not in the CSV file.
      You can process one file at a time, but that is rather tedious (unless you have only one or two such files).
      <ol>
        <li>Create a folder for the one tester, and place all the csv files there.</li>
        <li>They will all need renaming, and should be named so that they become sorted in date order when sorted by name. My recommendation is to use ISO-date format, for example "<i>&lt;profile-person&gt;</i>-DNArelatives-2023-05-21.csv"</li>
        <li>The default import at this stage will not overwrite records that are already saved -
           it will assume newer records are more valid and try starting with the newest file first.
          It lists each file as it reads it, so you can confirm the sequence.</li>
        <li>If you have placed returns (line-breaks) in the notes, then this will corrupt the import process and they should be edited out - both in the CSV and on the relative's 23andMe web page.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the appropriate profile person from the dropdown "<i>Select profile for import</i>" (see arrow in screenshot).</li>
        <li>Then click the <B>Import 23+Me CSV</B> button.</li>
        <li>select all the csv files for that profile person.</li>
        <li>Repeat for each profile kit that you manage.</li>
      </ul>
      
    </p>
    <h3>3. Migrate the content from the old database</h3>
    <p>
      This will transfer all the segments that you have painstakingly collected up to now.
      Simply click the "<B>Migrate V1 DB</B>" button and it will carry out the transfer.
      There are several stages, and there will be occasional updates in the area below the buttons.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Finalise the Migration</h3>
    <p>
      This will take several minutes.
      If you use this button then there will be some housekeeping, checking  that the database is self-consistent and some utility tables are calculated.
      It generates lists of ICWs that all share a common segment, as well as ICWs where the profile person shares the same segment with each but for some reason we cannot identify a 3-way overlap.
      These are planning for changes after the loss of information about shared overlap, but I am not sure at the moment how best to use the information (so at the moment it does nothing with the information).
    </p>
    <h2>Other options</h2>
    <p>
      There are various other operations that are active at this stage, although none are essential.
    </p>
    <h3>Reporting problems</h3>
    <p>
      If you need to report a bug, please copy/paste the content of the status area below the buttons, to give me some initial idea what might be happening.
    </p>
    <h3>view the DB status in the Settings Pop-up</h3>
    <p>If you go to the 529 settings popup, scroll to the bottom and you will see tables showing the sizes of the database tables and also your  profile list.
    </p>
    <h3>Dump Sqlite DB</h3>
    <p>
      This button will write the raw database file into a chosen folder on your normal filesystem.
      The operating database is not stored anywhere accessible to you, so this export is the only way to get a copy and a complete backup.
      There is at the moment no method to import such a DB file back into the extension, but that should be possible if necessary.
    </p>
    <h3>Import 529 CSV</h3>
    <p>
      This button allows you to re-import data that was exported for GDAT. It should never be necessary, but might be required if you have lost other data sources, or if you do not migrate before the facility is lost <i>in the next version of 529Renew</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Delete 529renew New Database</h3>
    <p>
      This button will completely delete the new database, should things get messsed up.
      You can then start the migration process again.
    </p>
    <h3>Backup old database</h3>
    <p>If you are reading this notice, it is already <i>no longer possible to export the database to CSV</i>.
      I would recommend copying the entire old database into a safe area. 
      Instructions are given in <a href="https://github.com/CameronD73/529renew/wiki/WebSQL-%E2%80%90-archiving-database" target="_blank">the 529Renew Wiki</a>.
      Exporting a CSV from here is relatively straight-forward, but I won't bother with detail unless it becomes necessary.
    </p>
    <h3>Empty OLD 529renew Database</h3>
    <p>
      Once you are happy with the migrated data, if you are not comfortable with archiving the database file, as described above,
      then you can save storage space by deleting the contents of the database.
      529Renew cannot actually delete the database.  A small, nearly empty, file will remain.
